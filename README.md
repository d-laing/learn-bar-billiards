# learn-bar-billiards
This repository is dedicated to Bar Billiards, a game that enjoys widespread popularity in pubs across the UK. Also, an experiment in designing, writing and publishing lightweight, Markdown-authored help content by a tech writer with increased amounts of time on his hands (and much to learn). All content my own.
