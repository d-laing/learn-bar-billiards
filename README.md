# Playing your First Turn

Every game begins by deciding who will start and then releasing the balls.

## Release the balls
1. Toss a coin to decide which player, or team, is to start.
2. Insert the required coin, usually Â£1, into the slot at the front of the table.
3. To release the balls into the trough, pull the coin lever out fully and push it firmly back into place. We're off!
4. Place the red ball on the dot between the baulk line and the 100 hole (see also Setting up the table).

## Take your first shot
1. Take any ball from the trough and place it within the D: this will be the cue ball.
2. Using the cue, strike the red ball with the cue ball; your goal is to pot either ball in any hole without committing a foul (see also Fouls).

  **Warning!** This isn't pool! Any ball can be the cue ball, as long as it's waiting in the trough.

### If you pot one or more balls without committing a foul:

Add up the score(s) indicated by the hole(s) and continue your turn by taking another ball from the trough, placing it within the D and striking it up the table. This is now the current score for your break. See also Fouls.

### If you fail to pot a ball
Your turn (and break) is over. Record any score achieved for the break and add it to your cumulative point score for the game. Play passes quickly to the next player.

### If you commit a foul
* If you commit a foul, you lose any score gained for the current break.
* Additionally, if you knock over the black skittle, you lose your entire cumulative points for the game so far
and start again from zero points on your next turn.

Committing any foul will end your turn immediately, with play passing quickly to the next player.
